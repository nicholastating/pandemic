# Commonly Overlooked Rules
- You do _not_ draw a replacement card after drawing an Epidemic card.
- You may Discover a Cure at _any_ Research Station - the color of its city does not need to match the disease you are curing.
- On your turn, you may take a card from another player, if you are both in the city that _matches_ the card you are taking.
- On your turn, you may take _any_ City card _from_ the Researcher (only), if you are both in the same city.
- Your hand limit applies immediately after getting a card from another player.
