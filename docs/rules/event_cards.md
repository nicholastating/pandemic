# Event Cards
During a turn, _any_ player may play Event cards. Playing an Event card is not an action. The player who plays an Event card decides how it is used.

Event cards can be played at _any time, except_ in between drawing and resolving a card.

_Note: When 2 epidemic cards are drawn together, events can be played after resolving the first epidemic._

_Example: During infections, the first Infection card drawn causes an outbreak. You may not play the Airlift Event card to move the Quarantine Specialist to prevent this. After this outbreak happens however, you may use Airlift to move the Quarantine specialist (to possibly protect other cities) before flipping over the next Infection card.

After playing an Event card, discard it to the Player Discard Pile.
