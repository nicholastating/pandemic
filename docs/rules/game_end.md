# Game End
The players _win_ as soon as cures to all 4 diseases are discovered.

_Note: The players do not have to eradicate all 4 diseases to win; just cure them. Once all diseases are cured, the game ends and players win immediately, no matter how many cubes are on the board._

There are 3 ways for the game to end and the players to lose:
- if the outbreaks marker reaches the last space of the Outbreaks Track,
- if you are unable to place the number of disease cubes _actually needed on the board_, or
- if a player cannot draw 2 Player cards after doing their actions.
