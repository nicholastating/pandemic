In  _Pandemic_, you and your fellow players are members of disease control team. You must work together to develop cures and prevent disease outbreaks, before 4 deadly diseases (Blue, Yellow, Black, and Red) contaminate humanity.

_Pandemic_ is a cooperative game. The players all win together or lose together.

The goal is to discover cures for all 4 diseases. The players lose if:
- 8 outbreaks occur (a worldwide panic happens)
- not enough disease cubes are left when needed (a disease spreads too much), or
- not enough player cards are left when needed (your team runs out of time)

Each player has a specific role with special abilities to improve the team's chances.
