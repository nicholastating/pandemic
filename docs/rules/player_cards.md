# Player Cards
When playing the Introductory game (4 epidemic cards), place your cards face up in front of you, for all players to see.

_Note: Only Player cards count towards your hand limit. Your Role and your reference cards are not part of your hand._

When playing the Standard (5 Epidemics) or Heroic (6 Epidemics) games, keep your cards private, so everyone has information to contribute to play discussions.

_Note: Experienced groups may decide to play with open hands, if desired, in these games._

Players may freely examine either discard pile at any time.
