## Contingency Planner

The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an Event card from anywhere in the Player Discard Pile and place it on their Role card. Only 1 Event card can be on their role card at a time. It does not count against their hand limit.

When the Contingency Planner plays the Event card on their role card, remove this Event card from the game (instead of discarding it).

## Dispatcher

The Dispatcher may, as an action, either:
- move any pawn, if its owner agrees, to any city containing another pawn, or
- move another player's pawn, if its owner agree, as if it were their own

Note: When moving a player's pawn as if it were your own, discard cards for Direct and Charter Flights from _your_ hand. A card discarded for a Charter flight must match the city the pawn is moving from.

The Dispatcher can only _move_ other players' pawns; they may not direct them to do other actions, such as Treat Disease.

## Medic

The Medic removes _all_ cubes, not 1, of the same color when doing the Treat Disease action.

If a disease has been cured, he automatically removes all cubes of that color from a city, simply by entering it or being there. This does not take an action.

Note: The Medic's automatic removal of cubes can occur on other players' turns, if they are moved by the Dispatcher or the Airlift Event.

The Medic also prevents placing disease cubes (and outbreaks) of cured diseases in their location.

## Operations Expert

The Operations Expert may, as an action, either:
- build a research station in his current city, without discarding (or using) a City card, or
- once per turn, move from a research station to any city by discarding any City card.

Note: The Dispatcher may not use the Operation Expert's special move ability when moving the Operation Expert's pawn.

## Quarantine Specialist

The Quarantine Specialist prevents both outbreaks and the placement of disease cubes in the city they are in _and_ all cities connected to that city. They do not affect cubes placed during setup.
