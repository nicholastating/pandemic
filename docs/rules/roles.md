## Contingency Planner

The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an Event card from anywhere in the Player Discard Pile and place it on their Role card. Only 1 Event card can be on their role card at a time. It does not count against their hand limit.

When the Contingency Planner plays the Event card on their role card, remove this Event card from the game (instead of discarding it).
