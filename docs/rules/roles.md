## Contingency Planner

The Contingency Planner may, as an action, take an Event card from anywhere in the Player Discard Pile and place it on their Role card. Only 1 Event card can be on their role card at a time. It does not count against their hand limit.

When the Contingency Planner plays the Event card on their role card, remove this Event card from the game (instead of discarding it).

## Dispatcher

The Dispatcher may, as an action, either:
- move any pawn, if its owner agrees, to any city containing another pawn, or
- move another player's pawn, if its owner agree, as if it were their own

Note: When moving a player's pawn as if it were your own, discard cards for Direct and Charter Flights from _your_ hand. A card discarded for a Charter flight must match the city the pawn is moving from.

The Dispatcher can only _move_ other players' pawns; they may not direct them to do other actions, such as Treat Disease.
