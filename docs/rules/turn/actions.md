# Actions

You may do up to 4 actions each turn.

Select any combination of the actions listed below. You may do the same action several times, each time counting as 1 action. Your role's special abilities may change how an action is done. Some actions involve discarding a card from your hand; all these discards go to the Player Discard Pile.

## Movement Actions

### Drive / Ferry
Move to a city connected by a white line to the one you are in.

_Note: A white line that goes off the board "wraps around" to the other edge and connects to a city. Example: Sydney and Los Angeles are connected._

### Direct Flight
Discard a City card to move to the city named on the card.

### Charter Flight
Discard the City card that _matches_ the city you are in to move to _any_ city.

### Shuttle Flight
Move from a city with a research station to any other city that has a research station.

## Other Actions

### Build a Research Station
Discard the City card that matches the city you are in to place a research station there. Take the research station from the pile next to the board. If all 6 research stations have been built, take a research station from anywhere on the board.

_Note: If more than 6 research stations were supplied, set any extra aside during setup._

### Treat Disease
Remove 1 disease cube from the city you are in, placing it in the cube supply next to the board. If this disease color has been cured (see Discover a Cure below), remove all cubes of that color from the city you are in.

If the _last_ cube of a _cured_ disease is removed from the board, this disease is _eradicated_. Flip its cure marker from its "vial" side to its "ðŸš«" side.

_Note: If there are cubes from several cured diseases in a city, you mist still Treat Disease once for each cured color to remove these cubes._

_Note: Eradicating a disease is not needed to win. However, when cities of an eradicated disease are infected, no new disease cubes are placed there (see Epidemics and Infections). Removing the last cube of a disease that is not cured has no effect._

### Share Knowledge
You can do this action in two ways:

_give_ the City card that matches the city you are in to another player, or

_take_ the City card that matches the city you are in from another player.

The other player must also be in the city with you. Both of you need to agree to do this.

If the player who gets the card now has more than 7 cards, that player must immediately discard a card or play an Event card.

_Example: If you have the Moscow City card and are with another player in Moscow, you can give this card to that player. Or, if another player has the Moscow card and you both are in Moscow, then you can take it from that player. In either case, you both must agree before handing the card over._

### Discover a Cure
At _any_ research station, discard 5 City cards of the same color from your hand to cure the disease _of that color_. Move the disease;s cure marker to its Cure Indicator.

If no cubes of this color are on the board, this disease is now _eradicated_. Flip its cure marker from its "vial" side to its "ðŸš«" side.

_Note: When a disease is cured, its cubes remain on the board and new cubes can still be placed during epidemics or infections (see Epidemics and Infections). However, treating this disease is now easier and you close to winning.
