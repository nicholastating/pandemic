# Draw Cards
After doing 4 actions, draw the top 2 cards together from the Player Deck.If, as you are about to draw, there are fewer than 2 cards left in the Player deck, the game ends and your team has lost! (Do _not_ reshuffle the discards to form a new deck.)

## Epidemic Cards
If your draws include any _Epidemic_ card, immediately do the following steps in order:

### 1. Increase
Move the infection rate marker forward 1 space on the Infection Rate Track

### 2. Infect
Draw the _bottom_ card from the Infection Deck. Unless its disease color has been eradicated, put 3 disease cubes of that color on the named city. If the city already has cubes of this color, do not add 3 cubes to it. Instead, add just enough cubes so that it has 3 cubes of this color and then an _outbreak_ of this disease occurs in the city (see _Outbreaks_). Discard this card to the Infection Discard Pile.

If you cannot place the number of cubes _actually needed on the board_, because there are not enough cubes of the needed color left in the supple, the game ends and your team has lost! This can occur during an epidemic, an outbreak, or infections (see Outbreaks and Infections).

### Intensify
Reshuffle just the cards in the Infection Discard Pule and place them on top of the Infection Deck.

When doing these steps, remember to draw from the bottom of the Infection Deck and to then reshuffle _only the Infection Discard Pile_, placing it on top of the existing Infection Deck.

It is rare but possible to draw 2 Epidemic cards at once. In this case, do all three steps above once and then again.

_Note: In this case in the second epidemic's Infection card will be the only card to "reshuffle", ending on top of the Infection Deck. An outbreak will then occur in this city during Infections (see Infections), unless an Event card is played to prevent this (see Event Cards)._

After resolving any Epidemic cards, remove them from the game. Do _not_ draw replacement cards for them.

## Hand Limit
If you ever have more than 7 cards in hand (after first resolving any Epidemic cards you may have drawn), discard cards or play Event cards until you have 7 cards in hand (see Event Cards).
