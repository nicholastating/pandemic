# Infections
Flip over as many Infection cards from the top of the Infection Deck as the current _infection rate_. This number is below the space of the Infection Rate Track that has the infection rate marker. Flip these cards over one at a time, infecting the city named on each card.

To infect a city, place 1 disease cube matching its color onto the city, unless this disease has been eradicated. If the city already has 3 cubes of this color, do not place a 4th cube. Instead, an _outbreak_ of this disease occurs in the city (see Outbreaks below). Discard this card to the Infection Discard Pile.

## Outbreaks
When a disease outbreak occurs, move the outbreaks marker forward 1 space on the Outbreaks Track. Then, place 1 cube of the disease color on every city connected to the city. If any of them already has 3 cubes of the disease color, do not place a 4th cube in those cities. Instead, in each of them, a _chain reaction outbreak_ occurs after the current outbreak is done.

When a chain reaction outbreak occurs, first move the outbreaks marker forward 1 space. Then, place cubes as above, except do not add a cube to cities that have already had an outbreak (or a chain reaction outbreak) as part of resolving the _current_ Infection card.

As a result of the outbreaks, a city may have disease cubes of multiple colors on it; up to 3 cubes of each color.

If the outbreaks marker reaches the last space of the Outbreaks Track, the game ends and your team has lost!
